7. *Draw phase*: If 5 or fewer cards in hand, draw 2 cards.  Else, nothing happens.  Reshuffle deck if necessary.

## Rules details

Victory/lose conditions: Player wins when an arbitrary number of victory points(15?) is accrued from defeating enemies.  Player loses if hit points reach 0.

Player hit points - The player has a maximum health of 10.

Hand size - Max hand size is 8.  You stop drawing cards from your regular draw phase once you hit 6 cards.  At the beginning of any turn you may skip all of your actions (you WILL take enemy damage though) to discard your hand and redraw up to the amount you held.

Tech cards (buy) - When purchased, they go directly on top of your deck.  If you draw cards at the end of the turn you will immediately draw it and have it for the coming turn.

Encounter cards - Split into 3 decks, of level 1, 2, and 3 difficulty enemies.  Each deck will contain ample cards and will be shuffled for randomness each game.  Player completes each deck once 5 VP are obtained from that particular deck.  Encounters are always played one at a time.

Full repair - Players are fully healed to 10 hp after Encounter decks 1 and 2 have each been completed.

Persistent damage - Enemy ships will retain all damage dealt to them turn to turn until they are defeated.
